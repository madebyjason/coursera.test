	Hello, Coursera!
</h1>
<h5>
	Hi, there! I'm Jason. Join me on my journey into the software development world!

	I'll be focusing on web development to start with, learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Resources utilized will include Coursera, FreeCodeCamp and Udemy. StackOverflow will, I'm sure, be a good friend!

	Thanks to all the people who make these resources, and GitHub, available so any one is able to learn to code.

	P.S. I love tacos.
